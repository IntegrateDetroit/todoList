# Setup

*Note*: [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) will need to be installed on your machine for running postman collections from the command line to work.

To verify if `node` is installed on your machine, run `node -v`. If a version number is printed to the console, you are all set!

`npm install`

## Usage

From the `e2e` directory, run:

`node test-runner.js <name-of-collection> <name-of-environment>`
